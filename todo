[v] implement Payment Packs. Limit for number of teachers students per university
            somewhat done, it is probably a terrible implementation but still is okay for a prototype
            need to add checkLimit function to a model

[v] implement payment system
            added a basic stripe for backend, still may require auto renewal etc
            need to prepare it for production add env variables etc
            can't check yet need front end side aswell
